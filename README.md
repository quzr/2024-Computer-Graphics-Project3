# 2024 Computer Graphics Project 3
## Introduction

This project is a combination of two projects: [NerfStudio][1] and [PhysGaussian][2]. The goal of this project is to generate a 3D scene with a neural radiance field (NeRF) and simulate the dynamics of the scene with a physics-integrated 3D Gaussian (PhysGaussian). The project is for the course 2024 Computer Graphics in Fudan University.

## Installation and Usage

The Installation and Usage of this project is the same as the original projects. Please refer to the README files of [NerfStudio][1] and [PhysGaussian][2] for more information.

## Results

The results of this project are shown in the `img` and `output` folders. The `img` folder contains the images of the generated 3D scene, and the `output` folder contains the videos of the dynamics simulation. The results are shown in slides and report , which are uploaded to the elearning.

## Contribution
The contributions of this project are shown in the report.

## Acknowledgement
We would like to thank the authors of the original projects for their great work. The original projects are [NerfStudio][1] and [PhysGaussian][2]. We would also like to thank the authors of the papers [3], [4], and [5] for their great work.
